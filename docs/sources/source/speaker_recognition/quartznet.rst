QuartzNet
---------

QuartzNet is a version of Jasper model with separable convolutions and larger filters. It can achieve performance
similar to Jasper but with an order of magnitude less parameters.
Similarly to Jasper, QuartzNet family of models are denoted as QuartzNet_[BxR] where B is the number of blocks, and R - the number of convolutional sub-blocks within a block. Each sub-block contains a 
1-D *separable* convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout:

We use a Quartznet encoder of 3x2 size with narrow filters. This encoder is connected to the decoder by using a statistics pooling layer. 
We experimented with various statistics pooling layers like a gram layer, a x-vector pooling layer, or super vector layer which is combination of the gram and x-vector layers.
the xvector layer is based on Mean and variance based statistics pooling, it is faster to train and very stable.
