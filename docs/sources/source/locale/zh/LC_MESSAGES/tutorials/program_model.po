":class:`NeuralModule<nemo.core.neural_modules.NeuralModule>` is an "
"abstraction between a layer and a neural network, for example: encoder, "
"decoder, language model, acoustic model, etc. Each "
":class:`NeuralModule<nemo.core.neural_modules.NeuralModule>` computes a "
"set of outputs from a set of inputs. Every "
":class:`NmTensor<nemo.core.neural_types.NmTensor>` has "
":class:`NeuralType<nemo.core.neural_types.NeuralType>` . "
":class:`NeuralType<nemo.core.neural_types.NeuralType>` describes tensor "
"semantics, axis' order and dimensions. These types are used to determine "
"how modules should be connected together."
