"QuartzNet is a version of Jasper :cite:`li2019jasper` model with "
"separable convolutions and larger filters. It can achieve performance "
"similar to Jasper but with an order of magnitude less parameters. "
"Similarly to Jasper, QuartzNet family of models are denoted as "
"QuartzNet_[BxR] where B is the number of blocks, and R - the number of "
"convolutional sub-blocks within a block. Each sub-block contains a 1-D "
"*separable* convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout:"
