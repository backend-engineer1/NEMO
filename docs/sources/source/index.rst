Neural Modules (NeMo) is a framework-agnostic toolkit for building AI applications powered by Neural Modules. Current support is for PyTorch framework.

A "Neural Module" is a block of code that computes a set of outputs from a set of inputs.

Neural Modulesâ€™ inputs and outputs have Neural Type for semantic checking.

An application built with NeMo is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of connected modules enabling researchers to define and build new speech and nlp networks easily through API Compatible modules.


**Introduction**

**Core Concepts and Features**

* `NeuralModule` class - represents and implements a neural module.
* `NmTensor` - represents activations which flow between neural modules' ports.
* `NeuralType` - represents types of modules' ports and NmTensors.
* `NeuralFactory` - to create neural modules and manage training.
* `Lazy execution` - when describing activation flow between neural modules, nothing happens until an "action" (such as `optimizer.optimize(...)` is called.
* `Collections` - NeMo comes with collections - related group of modules such as `nemo_asr` (for Speech Recognition) and `nemo_nlp` for NLP


**Requirements**

1) Python 3.6 or 3.7
2) PyTorch 1.2 or later with GPU support
3) NVIDIA APEX: https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex


**Getting started**

You can use NVIDIA `NGC NeMo container <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:nemo>`_ for the latest NeMo release and all dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Pull the docker
    docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:v0.9

    # Do one of the two following commands
    # Run Docker for docker version <19.03
    nvidia-docker run -it --rm --shm-size=8g -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:v0.9
    
    # Run Docker for docker version >=19.03
    docker run -it --rm --gpus all --shm-size=8g -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:v0.9

and begin using NeMo immediately.

If you have all requirements installed (or are using `NGC PyTorch container <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch>`_ ),
then you can simply use pip to install the latest released version (**currently 0.9.0**) of NeMo and its collections:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nemo-toolkit  # installs NeMo Core
    pip install nemo-asr # installs NeMo ASR collection
    pip install nemo-nlp # installs NeMo NLP collection
    pip install nemo-tts # installs NeMo TTS collection

**Tutorials**

* `Speech recognition <https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/asr/intro.html>`_
* `Natural language processing <https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/nlp/intro.html>`_
* `Speech synthesis <https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/tts/intro.html>`_

**Installing From Github**

If you prefer to use NeMo's latest development version (from GitHub) follow the steps below:

*Note*: For step 2 and 3, if you want to use NeMo in development mode, use: ``pip install -e .`` instead of ``pip install .``

1) Clone the repository ``git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git``
2) Go to NeMo folder and install the toolkit:

.. code-block:: bash

	cd NeMo/nemo
	pip install .

3) Install the collection(s) you want.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the ASR collection from collections/nemo_asr
    apt-get install libsndfile1
    cd NeMo/collections/nemo_asr
    pip install .

    # Install the NLP collection from collections/nemo_nlp
    cd NeMo/collections/nemo_nlp
    pip install .

    # Install the TTS collection from collections/nemo_tts
    cd NeMo/collections/nemo_tts
    pip install .

**Unittests**

This command runs unittests:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./reinstall.sh
    python -m unittest tests/*.py

**Building Docker Container**

The NeMo Docker image requires Docker Buildx which is included in Docker 19.03 and layer. To build a custom NeMo Docker image, run

.. code-block:: bash

    docker buildx build --build-arg NEMO_VERSION=$(git describe --tags) -t nemo .

The ``NEMO_VERSION`` build arg is required. We recommend always setting to ``git describe --tags`` so that the build is traceable and replicable.
At runtime, the value of ``NEMO_VERSION`` specified at build time is exposed as an environment variable.

You may also specify a build arg ``BASE_IMAGE`` to override the underlying version of PyTorch used, though there are no compatability guarantees.

For development purposes, you can also create a Docker image containing only NeMo's dependencies, and map your local development branch into the
container at runtime.

.. code-block:: bash

    # build the development container
    docker buildx build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:20.01-py3 --target nemo-deps -t nemo-devel .

    # launch the container, mapping local nemo into it
    cd <nemo_path>
    docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace/nemo --shm-size=8g -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:v0.9

    # install in development mode
    ./reinstall.sh
