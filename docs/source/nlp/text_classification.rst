Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)
========================================

We recommend you try this model in a Jupyter notebook \
(can run on `Google's Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb>`_.): \
`NeMo/tutorials/nlp/Text_Classification_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/nlp/Text_Classification_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb>`__.

Connect to an instance with a GPU (Runtime -> Change runtime type -> select "GPU" for hardware accelerator)

An example script on how to train the model could be found here: `NeMo/examples/nlp/text_classification <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/examples/nlp/text_classification>`__.
