WFST-based (Inverse) Text Normalization
=======================================

NeMo supports Text Normalization (TN) and Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) tasks via rule-based `nemo_text_processing` python package and Neural-based TN/ITN model.

`nemo_text_processing` that is installed with the `nemo_toolkit`, see :doc:`NeMo Introduction <../starthere/intro>` for installation details.
Additional requirements can be found in `setup.sh <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/nemo_text_processing/setup.sh>`_.

Tutorials on how to get started with WFST-based NeMo text normalization could be found `tutorials/text_processing <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/stable/tutorials/text_processing>`_.
