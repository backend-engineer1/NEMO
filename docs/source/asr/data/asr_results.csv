Model Name,Model Base Class,Description
QuartzNet15x5Base-En,EncDecCTCModel,"QuartzNet15x5 model trained on six datasets: LibriSpeech, Mozilla Common Voice (validated clips from en_1488h_2019-12-10), WSJ, Fisher, Switchboard, and NSC Singapore English. It was trained with Apex/Amp optimization level O1 for 600 epochs. The model achieves a WER of 3.79% on LibriSpeech dev-clean, and a WER of 10.05% on dev-other."
QuartzNet15x5Base-Zh,EncDecCTCModel,"QuartzNet15x5 model trained on ai-shell2 Mandarin Chinese dataset."
QuartzNet5x5LS,EncDecCTCModel,"QuartzNet5x5 model trained on LibriSpeech dataset only. The model achieves a WER of 5.37% on LibriSpeech dev-clean, and a WER of 15.69% on dev-other."
QuartzNet15x5NR-En,EncDecCTCModel,"Quartznet15x5 model trained for presence of noise. The base model QuartzNet15x5Base-En was finetuned with RIR and noise augmentation to make it more robust to noise. This model should be preferred for noisy speech transcription. This model achieves a WER of 3.96% on LibriSpeech dev-clean and a WER of 10.14% on dev-other."
Jasper10x5Dr-En,EncDecCTCModel,"JasperNet10x5Dr model trained on six datasets: LibriSpeech, Mozilla Common Voice (validated clips from en_1488h_2019-12-10), WSJ, Fisher, Switchboard, and NSC Singapore English. It was trained with Apex/Amp optimization level O1. The model achieves a WER of 3.37% on LibriSpeech dev-clean, 9.81% on dev-other."
