Speaker Recognition (SR)
========================

Speaker recognition is a broad research area which solves two major tasks: speaker identification (what is the identity of the speaker?) and speaker verification (is the speaker who they claim to be?). We focus on text-independent speaker recognition when the identity of the speaker is based on how the speech is spoken, not necessarily in what is being said. Typically such speaker recognition systems operate on unconstrained speech utterances, which are converted into vectors of fixed length, called speaker embeddings. Speaker embeddings can also be used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech synthesis.

The goal of most speaker recognition systems is to get good speaker level representations that could help distinguish oneself from other speakers. To achieve this, we first train a neural network model in an end-to-end manner optimizing the encoder using cross-entropy or angular softmax loss. We modify the decoder to get these fixed size embeddings irrespective of the length of the audio input and employ a pooling strategy such as mean and variance based statistics pooling or attention based method to generate these embeddings.

In speaker identification, we typically train on a larger training set with cross-entropy loss and fine-tune later on preferred set of labels where one would want to classify only known sets of speakers. 
On the other hand, in speaker verification, we train an embedding extractor with angular softmax loss and compare the embeddings from one audio file coming from a single speaker with embeddings from an unknown speaker. For quantifying the similarity of the embeddings we use scoring techniques such as cosine similarity.

Resource and Documentation Guide
--------------------------------

Hands-on speaker recognition tutorial notebooks can be found under
`the speaker recognition tutorials folder <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tutorials/speaker_tasks/>`_. This and most other tutorials can be run on Google Colab by specifying the link to the notebooks' GitHub pages on Colab.

If you are looking for information about a particular SpeakerNet model, or would like to find out more about the model
architectures available in the ``nemo_asr`` collection, check out the :doc:`Models <./models>` page.

Documentation on dataset preprocessing can be found on the :doc:`Datasets <./datasets>` page.
NeMo includes preprocessing and other scripts for speaker_recognition in <nemo/scripts/speaker_tasks/> folder, and this page contains instructions on running
those scripts. It also includes guidance for creating your own NeMo-compatible dataset, if you have your own data.

Information about how to load model checkpoints (either local files or pretrained ones from NGC), perform inference, as well as a list
of the checkpoints available on NGC are located on the :doc:`Checkpoints <./results>` page.

Documentation for configuration files specific to the ``nemo_asr`` models can be found on the
:doc:`Configuration Files <./configs>` page.


For a clear step-by-step tutorial we advise you to refer to the tutorials found in `folder <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tutorials/speaker_tasks/>`_.
