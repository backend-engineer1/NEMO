Text Denormalization
====================

Inverse text normalization (ITN), also called denormalization, is a part of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post-processing pipeline.
ITN is the task of converting the raw spoken output of the ASR model into its written form to improve the text readability.
For example, `in nineteen seventy` -> `in 1975` and `one hundred and twenty three dollars` -> `$123`.
