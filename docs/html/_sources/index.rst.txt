Neural Modules (NeMo) is a framework-agnostic toolkit for building AI applications powered by Neural Modules. Current support is for PyTorch framework.

A "Neural Module" is a block of code that computes a set of outputs from a set of inputs.

Neural Modulesâ€™ inputs and outputs have Neural Type for semantic checking.

An application built with NeMo application is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of connected modules enabling researchers to define and build new speech and nlp networks easily through API Compatible modules.


**Introduction**

See this video for a walk-through.

**Core Concepts and Features**

* `NeuralModule` class - represents and implements a neural module.
* `NmTensor` - represents activations which flow between neural modules' ports.
* `NeuralType` - represents types of modules' ports and NmTensors.
* `NeuralFactory` - to create neural modules and manage training.
* `Lazy execution` - when describing activation flow between neural modules, nothing happens until an "action" (such as `optimizer.optimize(...)` is called.
* `Collections` - NeMo comes with collections - related group of modules such as `nemo_asr` (for Speech Recognition) and `nemo_nlp` for NLP


**Requirements**

1) Python 3.6 or 3.7
2) PyTorch 1.2 with GPU support
3) NVIDIA APEX: https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex


**Getting started**

If desired, you can start with `NGC PyTorch container <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch>`_ which already includes
requirements above.

You can pull it like so: ``docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:19.08-py3``
and then continue with the following steps:


1) Clone the repository
2) Go to nemo folder and then: ``python setup.py install``
3) Install collections:
    * ASR collection from `collections/nemo_asr`:
        1. ``apt-get install libsndfile1``
        2. ``python setup.py install``

    * NLP collection from `collections/nemo_nlp`: ``python setup.py install``
4) For development you will need to: ``python setup.py develop`` instead of ``python setup.py install`` in Step (3.2) above
5) Go to `examples/start_here` to get started with few simple examples


**Unittests**

This command runs unittests:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./reinstall.sh
    python -m unittest tests/*.py
