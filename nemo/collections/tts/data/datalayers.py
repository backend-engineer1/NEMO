        Mostly compliant with nemo.collections.asr.data.datalayers.AudioToTextDataset except it only returns Audio
        without text. Dataset that loads tensors via a json file containing paths to audio files, transcripts, and
        durations (in seconds). Each new line is a different sample. Note that text is required, but is ignored for
        AudioDataset. Example below:
        {"audio_filepath": "/path/to/audio.wav", "text_filepath":
        "/path/to/audio.txt", "duration": 23.147}
        ...

        transcription", "offset": 301.75, "duration": 0.82, "utt":
        "utterance_id", "ctm_utt": "en_4156", "side": "A"}
        Args:
            manifest_filepath (str, Path): Path to manifest json as described above. Can be comma-separated paths
                such as "train_1.json,train_2.json" which is treated as two separate json files.
            n_segments (int): The length of audio in samples to load. For example, given a sample rate of 16kHz, and
                n_segments=16000, a random 1 second section of audio from the clip will be loaded. The section will
                be randomly sampled everytime the audio is batched. Can be set to -1 to load the entire audio.
            max_duration (float): If audio exceeds this length in seconds, it is filtered from the dataset.
                Defaults to None, which does not filter any audio.
            min_duration(float): If audio is less than this length in seconds, it is filtered from the dataset.
                Defaults to None, which does not filter any audio.
            trim (bool): Whether to use librosa.effects.trim on the audio clip
