A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer the United States than the number of people killed lightning.
Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter
this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of elections in the United States.
It this spirit that a majority have passed new since 2009 making the registration or process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained following the 2010 elections, which 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws voters to show a photo card and proof of US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record.
Before 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to such requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, sponsored bills in States to voters to photo ID card.
It is important to note that, Quebec, American citizens do not a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters 2012 do have identification.
And it often costs a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, of African 15% of those earning less than 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.
And that's not all.
voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States allow fishing or hunting members, who vote more Republican, to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote.
Prior to no proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona the to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the party.
What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they the right of individuals and groups to assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of in the State.
The same applied to Hispanics.
These only 11% of voters, of citizens who voted early.
the other hand, of voters were white but these represented only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the
For example, 16 out of 34 have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise right to vote in 2012.
critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see clear objective of influencing 2012 results in key States.
A 2011 Brennan report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.
It too early to say with certainty legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact the turn-out.
In this sense, the measures undermine the American democratic system.
screening: take the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes results with false negative or false positive results, which involve unnecessary medical interventions.
Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests.
Take the test not?
We two specialists for their opinion.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who screened and those were not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it is between 30 and 40% more likely for metastases to in the absence of screening.
I therefore recommend the test from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily prostate that are not long-term life and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring the
Today, many men in cancer been detected will be treated because their cancer not aggressive and is not life threatening.
Active monitoring will be suggested, if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated.
Therefore I recommend taking

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated if everyone ate well and exercised enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If more people this rate would increase to at least says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that roughly 10% of cancers are hereditary.

The Higgs boson revealed
The announcement of the probable of the boson created quite a last summer, and with good reason.
Indeed, it believed that part of the mechanism responsible for the mass everything the Universe, no less.
Also it is particle whose is predicted by the Model - our best or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle, and resembles the Higgs by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem confirm this, but are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure.
But let's suppose that it really the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem slim, see what it is.
In our world, there is fatally unavoidable law which that things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum - this "state" of certain of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
While lurking in the are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who nothing - at all events, not this principle, which that they can indeed be found in the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle site (absolutely extraordinary, by way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson be somehow related.
bosons, it must be stressed here, are not such exotic bugs as you might think.
In if you can read this article, it thanks to an extraordinarily banal the photon, or "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field this specific place, rather a pebble thrown in a pond.
This produces an electromagnetic (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be for the boson to appear.
Now, this field is much, more stable the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energy levels, rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large to wrinkle the surface.
Which is why a huge particle like the at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such levels.
The with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining relationship between the Higgs and mass.
fact not all particles, or all interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to fridge.
And likewise, not all interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not.
Now, what is it that all this research "can bring"? asks Ms Plamondon.
For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM.
A number of people, moreover, fervently hope that some will be found, because the slightest could open a door to a "new physics" and plug certain holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, has huge shortcomings, offering explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong assume that there won't be
Remember: in the very early 60s, pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work.
They had an of the scientific applications, but as to rest.
In fact, the late Willard Boyle - a physicist who at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a gadget."
imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although this was not at all the intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009.

With its Dying with Dignity Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.

However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.

Just a few ago Mr L. lived alone in his Montérégie
The festering prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made it to seven," he says, with mixed emotions, lying in his bed Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can never be prepared for it" he adds.

The of ordinary death.
"What I want most is be cured of my diarrhoea, it's humiliating" he confided.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness.
"During our lives, we a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Regressing to the stage of a child, for people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very of such regression.
Patients at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear to die "conscious and suffocating."
But disease made discover my children.
"I have fine she adds.
"I don't wish for anything more in life" she says, before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe.
She looks forward nevertheless, in next few days, to a last visit by her son coming from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding.
This is palliative given when there is else that can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are palliative care beds for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is few when we know that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the at home.
Whether at a comfort, or spiritual level.
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy Pepsi, is their tipple.
Diabetics no longer need control their blood sugar.
And death is part everyday life.
Yesterday evening, a beer was served to Mr who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer the feet of deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients" says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, one day follows another but no two are alike.
Along with a 93-year-old man is savouring his last meeting with his family, sitting firmly wedged in his pillows toasts are drunk in his a 36-year-young man is dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, having tried everything to survive.
"For six there have always been three to five beds which occupied by cancer patients less than 45 old" says a concerned Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home from their homes, 47% from hospital.
Lack of access to palliative
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached terminal stage of life, be it at home, in hospital in a care
And a organisations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients.
It precisely this large Quebec health care which has made a number palliative care physicians fear the adoption a law on euthanasia and suicide.
October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, been to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled quality palliative care before it is accepted proceed to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without anything being done to ease suffering.
I'm afraid patients ask to die because they don't adequate care.
And at the same time, some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day, despite the prognoses.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gruelling chemotherapy.
When announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me she regretted that I had up fighting, said.
had told me I was finished!
No care
Dr Martel believes that of patients to die thank care-givers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
to Elsie Monereau, Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Montreal, are resistant to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
At very end of life, physicians then often resort to palliative sedation, which equivalent to putting the to sleep until the time death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to this part of their suffering.
Increasingly, an unrelieved patient will have the option of having palliative sedation.
who are not relieved always say the same thing: "I to die."
But this does not necessarily "I want you to euthanise me," it means "I want to be relieved."

Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
Day after day highway officials, contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they of a formidable "system," combining the building industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organised crime.
"industry" which has cost Quebec taxpayers especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system is since we took measures" says Jacques Duchesneau a Quebec politician and former Montreal of Police.
was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, in in-depth into corruption related to road construction contracts Quebec, which the liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established direct link industry, under-the-table financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the inquiry opened in 2010, he says, Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved billion dollars on contracts," with certain people curbing their to get a share!
Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors" he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "revealing the schemes behind the
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in is also coupled with its army of government analysts, and auditors.
Plus the "Marteau squad" policemen who, since 2009, have apparently led the Montreal "sewer cartel" soft pedal on the contracts...
In recent it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and against municipal politicians, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is apparently Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his as Mayor of Laval, third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts "system" to the commission.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor party.
Mr Zambito has handed out freely in the 2000s, giving 88,000 Canadian dollars (roughly 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy-Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" ran smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, described it in detail in front of the commission: in ten he received from construction gifts, invitations trips, golf restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts of which the costs.
Other officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40%, and by add-ons.
Then an organiser the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr of deliberately closed eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the women in Montreal to raise the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the East of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for million dollars and for... 1.6 million to developers, at the height of the real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented, she says she "is following a thread in to find out how the system - infiltrated by - works, to put stop to the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she says, is "painful but
The wound is being cleaned, but Montreal would need its investigative unit with ongoing to avoid the return of these questionable practices.
How to clean house.
Properly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is concerned the role of "elected people aware of they were not up to their necks in the scam!
Estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he says dryly: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of
The Quebec government proposes limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but this not the situation, he says: "Until election expenses are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
advocates complete overhaul the system for granting public contracts and party funding: can't go lower; getting to the bottom of things, with will to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with controls and laws."
Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their backyard...

Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between electronic addresses like with e-mail.
Except that user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.

A new gamble for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to go broke.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given Assembly two more months to finish work.
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text, amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country.

His supporters affirm that this the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, by speeding up the transition process.

Mohammed seems convinced that Egyptians will favourably, as he stated in an interview with the American Time.

Commentators were also amused that one of the only of the day was expressed with regard to... the hour of prayer, some Committee members feeling that the Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday has 234 articles.
main focus of attention, article 2, remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia the main source law."
Salafist parties, for which of Islamic law is major claim, were hoping to replace "the principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society.

The highlight of action was the meeting near McDonald's by Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One them, Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's claims it billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or you for honest work!"
Demonstrators were supported other NY democrats, Bill de Blasio, a candidate for NY city mayor, who said: "We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees, so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing, which every New Yorker deserves!."
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action this kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only few hundred people took part in and many of them were fast food employees, tens thousands of people in York.
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a movement.
"At the moment, the mind cannot be deceived too well"
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented lately primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At first, a functional was by Google in the summer, at its annual conference. Then, in it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too.
However, to the with the leader of the group of 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Izadi, glasses are thing of the for scientists in this company.
They are drawn by the prospect of manipulating in the air hands, creating spaces.
- Please tell us, in simple terms, about the work your research group does.
We work on the interaction of people with machines, at same time to the boundaries of this interaction.
While people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and pointing at them.
We want to look 5-10 years into the future and cardinal changes in interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a forward. Almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because likes control by gestures.
- What else us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect shifted the interaction to physical level, much still occurs on a screen, sometimes in
Information entry has improved (the more data), but still needs to get better.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our it more tangible.
But for this, we need to identify both the user and the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
Above all, get of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about
It's a popular thing, but is it overestimated?
- It clearly cannot be called cure-for-all - a question of because we do not always want to let others know about our actions and intentions.
In reality, all of interaction computers are good, but each in their own niche.
For example, we a project to control public places, which we about movements, not movements, small, reserved
Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones muscles.
It's big right now, but in theory it can be reduced the size a hand watch.
In general, future lies in the control, e.g. +
What do you mean?
For example, how would me to give you this bottle of water?
You talk and show at the same time.
- Usually I just say.
Oh, will be very hard to detect.
So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approximation.
I think in the future, we will work on developing new sensors that will enable precise determination of a person's reaction.
This could be, e.g. laser sensors. They have a resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something
- In the current generation what can base ourselves on working on three-dimensional recognition.
course, it would be good to eight mega pixels with 1000 k/s
It's not just the mega pixels, though, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us this work to the algorithm designers.
So it's important to remember the resolution on the X, Y, but also the Z axis.
Speed, the of images per second, is also very important.
Human movements are relatively dynamic, and the current 30 k/s really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with regulated processing delay from 1 100 ms, while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the between and
In my work, would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second.
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased?
- In Kinect there three cameras now, one of which is an infrared emitter and the second one, the recipient of the signal.
third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range.
It is not applied to determine the object's depth.
Potentially, a large number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse, by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a analogue Kinect, play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination the position.
- As far I remember, Microsoft did not present its glasses the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday of reality technologies?
- Certainly not very convenient to walk around a smart your raised hands all the time, but I that the coolest option be "transitional" augmented where you could shift from glasses to smart phone, projection display, and everywhere else based on a cloud
Glasses a very personal device, that is their strength (private things are by you) and, at the same time, their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will you work virtual objects together with other people.
us imagine for a minute manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not to Tony Stark from Ironman, but to a regular person.
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh attempt at the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the will probably be the addition of tactile sensations.
For now, one of the tricks is to use the hand as a sort of matrix for the image.
It is great at registering
But are technologies that are at giving these "images in the air" a sense of tangibility, for the interference of ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation, but very weak now, as if someone blew on fingertip.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings fingers, which is a promising area.
- Have you to deceive the mind?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something?
- This is good idea and haven't tried this yet.
It conceals one challenge that not be solved so quickly - how to force a person, who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along open, almost limitless space; working on the concept of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and giant
So far deceiving the mind has had limited success, there's work for many years to come.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to - many things are in their very beginnings.
Judgement calls of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the St. Petersburg Avant-garde, dedicated to residents who are ahead, the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose reach the scope of the city, often recognized bypassing fame in Russia.
The new player in - the bold Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed all in red, who can be seen by the Russian Museum, or the Summer Garden, at fashionable parties and shows.
Kirill work always brings in crowds of people, no matter where they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding man of the Petersburg avant-garde the late early 90's.
Moreover, he is a city man, who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone's spirit.
Recently he took street organ and became St. Petersburg's music man, because he was ready for this role with all his Bohemian existence, and image.

But everything is blurred in clowns, tragedy is removed.

- what is St. Petersburg missing?
- cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an culture.
not everyone can be engaged in culture.
Under the right rulers everything was different. Kings not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts.
There are consultants in Moscow right now.
Here in are people who could be experts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correctly evaluate these and give way to them.
Judgement calls are what thrive
Even Erart, they're different because they honestly that we don't accept all modern art. There are some artists, who need to find other museums for themselves.

Give birth in
The earth is danger.
Global warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the is how to propagate race in conditions of weightlessness or replacement planet?
I think the choice is small.
There are only two actual planets can be explored even hypothetically.
"Venus and Mars," says Senior Researcher of the P.K. Shternberg State Astronomy Institute (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin.
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life, Venus has 500-degree temperatures.
Life is possible only at a altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
question of reproduction in space began flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were run on plants.
generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth
Then, insects were bred in orbit, small fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs sent to space, to check how an embryo weightlessness.
We an absolutely normal chick.
But then begins.
"The problem is related to the fact that this chick needs to support, needs get on its feet and start moving," explains of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Having found support, chicks were tumbling around in disorder.
After 10 hours, the newborns experienced complete atrophy of instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And the was they simply died after four days.
"We bred chicks twice there, and then stopped, because it is impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, confirming the of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last "mini-ark" with animals flew into orbit 16 years
In spring 2013, will continue.
only beings will be on the Bion bio-satellite.
There was experiment with rats, who were sent to space with foetus.
In principle, there was nothing extraordinary there.
"This was on bio-satellites, but again, it was a singular experiment and such research needs to says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had babies.
But it's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly space.
It's not easy task.
Animals cannot follow their sexual instinct, when out of their familiar environment.
In principle, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens have and are able to create a fitting emotional
Such not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women been flying to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body.
Our "Seagull" and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space.
Whether she will able to give birth after flight.
"Nobody answered this question," says rocket and industry veteran, Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only year flying to space, the first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana who went into orbit twice and worked in open space, gave birth to a son.
the risk remains.
We have few, very few cosmonauts, who were OK and had healthy children after long flights.
"What's more, it is even orbital flights," adds pilot and cosmonaut, Hero the USSR, Hero of Russia, Valery
And humanity needs to seek out some avenues in protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
Hydro-laboratory of CPK - mandatory phase of training for a flight.
Here, cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in conditions.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water is a medium, although for infants it is a native element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm that came to land from the ocean.
There is a connection that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb; it is easier to get used to water after that.
In it is logical, because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing.
"This is very little time to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for newborn weightlessness is more a woman needs gravity, earth's pull.
Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate weightlessness; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced.
Well, let's assume that childbirth stimulators work out.
Maybe she will out the baby in a special room.
"Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue.
On the hand, a baby also needs artificial
When a body does not feel earth's pull, it does not form skeletal and muscular system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit a special loading suit for training, as they do adults.
He will not have what he needs to survive.
"And this that will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead bringing a handicapped, completely unadapted human to earth," predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
For the moment, birth of children in space is just a theory.
However, with time, it will become when will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space.
Head: Svarc System audit has failed because politicians.
Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in their application.
This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview Aktualne.cz.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, on current situation.
conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from Czech and German
As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr approach to the so-called "Svarc System."
The Prime Minister recently that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so it forbidden or allowed?
"The Law must be set out one or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce,"
At the audit session in the House of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared.
What exactly was
This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago.
put, this is how European legislation governs the handling of public by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself.
We brought all together, and although the is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "more concise and complete," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany.
This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws.
What does this project actually help you and what do you think its outcome will bring?
kind of joint could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and criminal proceedings may be avoided.
just we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts.
does the audit system work in Germany?
Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently?
As far as the office is the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU, and it is organised like it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently, but basically both offices operate similarly.
Powers are similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised so these of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect system slightly differs from our own.
The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds.
Public funds, for us, are regional and municipal authorities, audited by the federal courts auditors there.
When it to legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, nevertheless in Germany serves as an example, but it cannot be said that it is better aspect.
Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforcement?
is certainly true, again, I prefer not to such comparisons.
It should be said that even in a country we perceive as they encounter a whole range of problems.
If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they?
Coming back to legislation, what the amendment to contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already?
The period since the amendment into force has been quite short, it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
Since we carry out ex-post, a certain delay has be taken into account.
As yet, we have observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure detection" system, with which we have processed almost thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, rather as another burden on the system?
this is a step in the right direction, and hope will be confirmed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of discipline.
Is it worth constraining the law in this way, in case?
I do not think this the way.
The should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.
This of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy.
how can we get out of this?
Let's where this dead-end takes us.
The Prime Minister recently said the ODS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so-called "Svarc - what does this mean?
Is the System prohibited or allowed?
The Law must set out one way the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the prevent the work of its department, which is to monitor enforce.
He may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it not there.
The law public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected.
On the other hand, it is a tragedy, when bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality.
The will never be perfect, but its should be just - this is what we are in opinion.
Roads icy in places, but mostly passable.
In in the Czech Republic, the main roads are icy and snowy.
However, the majority of roads are passable, with extra care needed in places.

In the Carlsbad region, the roads been usable this morning, though in some places they icy and snowy.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, though it is expected get warm slightly during the day.
Snowing in the region has stopped, only of snow remains the lowlands.
However, the ridges of the Krusne Mountains have around 30 centimetres of snow.
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist, according to the local highway service.
The R6 high-speed motorway primary roads in the region are usable without restriction.
Caution is, of course, appropriate, for example, on certain bridges, where the surface be icy and slippery.

Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequented roads in the Forest.
Olomouc region
Drivers should expect snow slush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Olomouc region.
It is result of the chemical treatment carried out sedlo and on the way Videlsky Kriz.
Snowploughs were brought out by falling overnight, the Sumperk region, highway maintenance, got around three centimetres of snow.
In other of the region, roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the Sumperk region, traces of snow have remained at highest altitudes.
Drivers should expect snow slush at Cervenohorske sedlo in the direction of Jesenik," the dispatch officer for Sumperk highway service told today.
Their Jesenik also made an outing the roads the way to the highest altitudes are now and wet following the chemical treatment, according to them.
The Olomouc region's roads are usable without restriction, while in the area Sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas, where roads have remained wet.

Icy frost patches have been reported in particular by maintenance around Steti.
According to meteorologists the conditions for were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day, with a night and freezing temperatures.
Adverse conditions are expected on the sections of I/13 road between the Usti nad Labem and Liberec regions.

Simon Ornest: At the concerts want a fusion energy
What is opinion on the of world that might in less than a month?
It is just startler, which we like latch to.
Together with The Tap Tap band, to saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert end of the world completely.
In December you even organising a series of three concerts against the end the
Can you give readers some details on this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event, which we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided make use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar, due on the 21st December at a.m.
the eve, the 20th of December, at 9pm, 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Brno, and Ostrava.
They will end at around the time when Kiribati in the Pacific, is 12 hours ahead of us, reaches the end of the Mayan calendar.
came up with this idea?
it was probably my idea, later we worked all the details out with designer, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet, when we, one day, hand it over our children.
On the occasion of of the Mayan calendar, we have also prepared a range of unique shoes, t-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end the world, which can be purchased www.e-tap.cz to support our cause.
The Tap Tap band, together with other artists, also recorded so-called anthem against the of the world, called "The End of the World cancelled."
It is already well received on YouTube, will it figure at the fund-raising concerts?
for the grand finale, long as the world does end
sung by all the artists all the three concerts at the same time.
The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words were written and the role of Jesus in video clip was played by Tomas Hanak, Xindl X also sings in it...
did you end up working with them?
We also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to a lot of fund-raising events and concerts...
We try to really get them involved in these projects.
It turns out most of them are and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
Equipping the wheelchair-accessible educational Studeo centre, which is already in its sixth year, in collaboration with the citizens association Tap the for the disabled.
Tutors come in regularly to spend with the Jedlicka Institute's students and run activities, which they enjoy and interest them.
students themselves do not have the funds to tutors, so we try to provide this for them way.
Within the construction at the Jedlicka Institute, a separate which we move into with this project.
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists.
How do you select
We have tried to a programme, which speaks for all ages, including children.
For in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear.
Further details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future?
In May, we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring, so will definitely be preparing a good with interesting guests.
year, we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally - since we will in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your international plans are modest; you have already performed, for instance, in Madrid, Brussels, London, Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people.
How do with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation?
is not as as it might seem at first.
We have members electric wheelchairs, which must be transported in the luggage area; we also, course, carry with us a lot luggage and instrument cases...
Nevertheless, we have so far managed it without any problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, so much so on occasion, I was surprised.
Even in Moscow, which have just returned from, it all went smoothly.
Thanks to these international trips, you have had a chance to compare accessibility issues, public attitudes to disability and on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places, where everything functions better than here, we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Moscow is rather inaccessible; it still remains unusual there a person in electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or
Obvious things, such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts, not commonplace there.
Fortunately, citizens associations are there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems by people with disabilities.
And on the other hand, where do we still lag behind more advanced countries?
There are a lot of which still lag behind on...
It is important to that improvements to current always depend on the efforts of people who affected.
In London and is completely natural for people with handicaps to be independently out in public, and they can use the toilets, go to the museum, or wherever...
It is less common for large groups of people with to actively take part social life, in this respect with The Tap we are a step
Public respect or accessibility one thing, but it is only we can become famous athletes, artists, actors, or lawyers that will really begin to change.
So far there only exceptional cases, people who are strong-willed.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let us look back a few what you in 1998 to form it?
I began my job as tutor at the Jedlicka Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people, who were interested in doing something.
Since am a myself - among others I play the saxophone - I started a music club with a colleague.
With time, as moderator Ladya Angelovic says, it has grown a little out of control (laugh).
Your popularity has about in the last few years, or I mistaken?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band.
We realised that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed.
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors, equipment and so on.
it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights?
From the I felt there was potential to do things little differently.
Show business is filled with things, where the other.
It is logical in its own way; all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time.
Things, which are are few and far between, but would dare claim that Tap Tap is one those things.
A person's first impression on seeing you is, of course, pity - it is a natural
But that pity is wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and beings, who to be pitied.
They are people, who can fully live life and blossom, assuming, of course, that have the right environment
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole.
Has your success also been by your firm hand as a leader, as many people suggesting?
If we want to achieve top class work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require certain level of discipline.
I think this is to be expected.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds, and when they find they have to to twice a week, attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts, their quickly disappears.
That is how works everywhere, every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members.
How many of those were at the 1998?
Only one, Ladya Angelovic.
We are an open group, come and people go, this is unavoidable.
Those who have the interest and drive always door open.
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected, on Thursday from 9pm.
venues will be Praha Incheba, Brno Fleda, and Ostrava Plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
All three cities will joined by a televised link-up at the evening's close for a united rendition of The Tap's anthem "The End of the World is

Last the council of ministers of the European Space Agency the twentieth member of the agency, being second nation from the former (after the Czech Republic, which became a fledged member the ESA the 12th of November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the following it participated in a series of agency projects.
Poland's path to the space had begun much earlier.
devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, were not always met with understanding.
I look for instance, to the lecture of A Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomy observatory, who, on the 6th of 1933, presented ideas on his pioneering work into space.
The thoughts of the young (born 1905) left his audience cold, and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown an interest his work.
In 1934, for his work into space, Sternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France.
above mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski - 1966) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals, wrote a series of books on scientific
Gadomski a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, notably, recognised when a crater on the far side of Moon was named after him.
In 1925, Poland had already built a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, both the project's designer, and the project's details, are unknown.
is not even clear, whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar slow it
Information about this rail track is only known from press of the time.
In 1933 the artillery started their engagement in flying bombs.
The research undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the documents, it is that the research reached stage of practical tests.
Of course, the of the German army interrupted the research.
In 1937, the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by Rohozinski in the trade press, and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket-bomb appeared, authored by Leliwy-Krywoblocki.
Both projects were destined for military use rocket engines.
Immediately prior to War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work.
The Board was appointed 1937, but after two years of activity operations were ended by the start of the War.
Further devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish Press after War to the Astronautics Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first reference to the company figures the November issue of the magazine Problems 1954, in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astronautics.
In one of by Prof. Subotowicz, the establishment a company is proposed, which would dedicate itself to astronautics.
At the time, there were already for artificial satellites it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector.
From beginning of 1956, the Polish Company sought entry to the Astronautics Federation (est. 1951) and by autumn the already a full member.
In the year, the PTA's first chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - was appointed Deputy Chairman the International Astronautics Federation.
served in this capacity until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA played significant role in the successful of meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research.
The first RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th October 1958.
The with ceiling 1800 metres, around cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg.
Later, the improved RM-1A was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude
Of in further research was stopped.
The to RM rocket was the Meteor-1 developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, -1C), which differed in the room available scientific apparatus.
the rocket, a space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude all three was 37km.
Between and 1968, the development of Meteor-2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute, with its first launch tests in 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful of 10 kg to a height of around 60km.
Subsequently built models were the and Meteor-3.
Poland's admission to COSPAR for Research) in 1960 should be mentioned, well as of a national COSPAR board later.
participated in the space programme for space on artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut Vladimir Remkov.
Abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution.
Last week the Court abolished the law public works.
The resolution lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
oriented financial systems in the EU, just as those in the globalised world, are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition.
Its effect means that entities and national economic systems in a state of permanent conflict among themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade free, completely unregulated movement of private capital together uncontrolled financial speculation.
Due to significant labour cost differences (salaries) there is pressure on prices.
On this basis, it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, is pulled" from under the competition's to capture greater market share and, in this way, increase its own profits.
On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheaply from abroad, down. The result is high unemployment in where labour costs are high compared other economies.
Since private capital is not bound by responsibility, therefore also not by the unemployment it the social costs born by the must necessarily increase.
The whole is bolstered the businessman's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would the economical and social harm the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for statistical data.
The ruthless practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, to artificially lower the social standard of own citizens in order to attract foreign investment.
In other words, governments stake own citizens because of private capital while the drop in social standards.
This occurs in amendments to existing law.
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital, in terms salaries.
On one hand, this economic of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the restricted employee rights in workplace.
This growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich.
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
The number these people already in the millions.
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it to the minimum
Just such a was revealed in the case of auxiliary in Bundestag.
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states undoubtedly to the situation, people are pressured by catastrophic drop in living standards emigrate as it was in 19th or to eke out an existence on starvation on edge of society, in the hope that country eventually see investment.
this have to ask where this come from?
If it is to come from other EU states, poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at because Chinese, Indian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the Media claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
capital cruelly insists on viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby whole country, its own selfish ends.
Here, the answer be yes.
The is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, lobby.
The result a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, nothing is
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws private firms, who are basically connected with industry.
These laws are then approved in the Bundestag.
Real power does not come from the as Western-style constitutions claim, from strong financial organisations look after their own interests.
It is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described Appian in his work on the Roman Crisis the time of Cesar and "The State was already in degeneration and its offices taken by force.
With bribery, acquisition of benefits, and stones or swords.
and corruption were rife unhindered, and the people would for a result which had been bought" with principles did not run for office, so on one occasion the whole debacle the state went eight months without consuls.." .."There was actually talk about only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy, and an energetic man should be elected." Appian had Pompei in mind, but it Cesar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently.
The conclusion, just as in the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital in its present state not able to understand the interests of society as a
The outcome is now, as was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms.
The causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore sought the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and centuries.
The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in of liberalised as an interlude, can expect its next cycle.
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as crimes humanity, as we are familiar with from ancient modern history.
The abolition of the law on public is not the at least the long term.
the pressure economic competition, internationally well as within Europe, Government of the will forced to pursue of lowering the population's standards.
This pattern is thus systemic.
To address this, are political and social reforms, which strengthen the capital participation in the economy, increase the people's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held capital over society in of the state.

The latest of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as has a lot of reaction.
Some by Israel, arguing it has the right to self-defence, and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming racism by the Israeli state, claiming genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs, and that Israel is terrorist state.
I do want to dwell, in repeated periodic waves of killing, who is the transgressor and who is the victim, after today's inhabitants of Israel, including the territories, were born into the current political situation, not live through the start of the violence.
I the readers a peek behind scenes, a look at whom, most of all, this 95-year long tension is serving (starting from Balfour's declaration November 1917) on this small piece of land in the East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by historical facts, while others own understanding who, that is, group of people is the main source events in modern history.
Human history the first about the struggle for power.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path independently, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their a pre-calculated goal.
We accept that we live in a time world's wealth is concentrated into hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be the puppet master (whether else above am unsure, but I would not rule out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency they bought in the of 19th century, in order to prevent their name being with acts high criminality, which appeared in their background and always meant securing power, increasing wealth, or both.
They hold majority in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted central bank to the Russian Government).
Whoever attempted to defy this family died.

JFK began issuing his own money and to close the Fed (Federal Reserve), and was killed in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, he had intended to sue Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their power led the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan by the freemason leader of 33rd degree, Albert Pike.
The war was remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially and the third reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power.
The which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the employ is instigation of crises, followed by offering of a solution (order chao - order chaos).
These solutions are false, however, and lead to a worse (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis 1907 would be

The World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German (the war was no longer needed to Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled.
To facilitate the inception of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create latent conflict situation by saddling Germany with huge war reparations, thereby making radicalist example of the impoverished masses, it only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution, while also creating a multi-racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed did, the role of a fifth colony, once the war had been ignited.
At the end the 19th Century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, branch which strove to Jewish State, seeking out an area of historic Judea, Jerusalem, to make its capital (the Return to Zion).
The aforementioned Declaration formed the basis for immigration of Jews to Palestine, where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free the leash, which international were holding him on, or whether his actions were all part of the plan, is to determine, nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the acceptance of the Jewish State.

Who is the and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an cycle of violence, while everything began from the greed of a and their lust for global power?
Here, we must differentiate between Israel's general and their leaders, because, just as it happens here, the international introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for.
Israel's current prime minister, hawk', is a typical example a politician, loyal to the international bankers, does everything to instigate war with which would, due its in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, Russia, Pakistan, ...) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control the Hormuz where 20% of the world's oil must sail (the only 2 miles wide), to the destruction of the world's

In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades.

For the story to be believed, the film project was reported on in specialist magazines, press were organised, and the fictitious production had a real office.
details of the operation were, for a long time, kept secret; the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a peculiar mix of genres.
On one hand, there is a realistic thriller, and at the same time a "caper movie," with small victories and double-crossing - another example would be Ocean's Eleven.
The mood alternates in the film - on one sharp documentary-style sequences in Tehran (the sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time, relating to the same events portrayed the film - there are no big differences).
the other hand, lighter sections from Hollywood, laced with irony and a little exaggeration.
Then there scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables, in office corridors, over the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style.
The derided actor has become a respected director, and his acting no longer target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third big-screen movie, following his dark crime movie Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town
It is also Affleck's first picture, which does not take place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics, which took his earlier above Hollywood standards.

The best scenes of the film take in the streets, in the reconstruction of events - the opening sequence of the siege on embassy impressively lucid, at once feelings of confusion and surprise, which come flooding in, as history suddenly takes a
similar effect is achieved Affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes (the fake at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much too many places
The director had to tackle the issue the story told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film.
What little there is, is worked well, with occasional embellishments to reality - these do not all come off so (the scene, where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran by phone call in America, followed a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
weakness is its divergence, which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm; their characters deserve room, and are not by far the only ones in this film.

The ban on the use of the term butter" and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism.
First rate bananas are to measure 14 centimetres
The Union's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this that commercial or industrial lobbying group, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group states' interests (just as the Czech Republic promoting the of its banks under threat of being vetoed).
The lobby's interests were, for example, that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU, and were not to display and "anomalous

Strange ideas are conceived at home too
Fairly absurd is the rule relating European officials - everyone in EU, who holds an post, may not use term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece, and instead the acronym (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be used.
The Bankovnipoplatky.com in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Faire, also nominated, aside from the aforementioned absurdities, for example the Union's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state.
The stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions, which may be present within the CR the day of our entry to the Union.
The Republic thereafter exceeded, for instance, the permitted volume of mushroom preserves, which a high penalty.
The poll's organisers were also impressed by the of paying countries because they have a coastline, or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, however, but from Prague.
"We are handicapped because do not have sea.
We are the European Union for a refund," declared the minister for agriculture, back in autumn 2004, Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
His argument was there had been good harvest of cereals, due to the buy-out interventions, the state's warehouses full and were forced to export.
The Czech Republic further from a port, according to Palas the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros.
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding to subsidise funding was foreigners by the for Development's minister, Pavel Nemec specifically this was meant making requests for funding from Brussels.
Bizarre legislation is exception
Regulations may well become the target of criticism member states, the EU's efforts at regulation, more effective operation, and of the entire Union deserve recognition, to a number of experts.
A more important issue, according to experts, is the drawing of EU on projects, which have hardly common with strengthening the European integration, but which pushed through by member states during a budget meeting.
Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other countries in the Union, the CR must fight in Brussels right to particular labelling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed.
The Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect labelling of their Olomoucke tvaruzky, however tuzemsky rum, whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here, had to be renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers.
The appellation rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar, and not sugar beet.

When I lobbied, as a citizen, for tour guide work to be a free trade, it was successfully carried through.
The problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from left the right, will be deliberately rejected, causing delays for the public.

From the Czech viewpoint, it seems tend me to the left.

The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and recently erected Bücherberg (literally "book mountain") - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at," Verhaig, a passer-by at the road-side.
And Stefan Spermon, in major firm nearby commented: "It's definitely a beauty, the building."
However, I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and eBooks.
goes into of these old-style libraries voluntarily nowadays, or I wrong?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy outside the gates of Rotterdam, which barely merits a visit, is a special record-holder.
The 80,000-resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this asinine situation, the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty, painted concrete miniatures.
The of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics: library had be built!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam-based architectural firm master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings, took the project on with his customary composure, and turned at the competitive hearing in 2003 five books his arm and a on his face.
And with the judging still looking at with shrugging their shoulders, impertinent Maas his chosen props by order of size to form pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed with action - with the "Dear Municipality!"
So this is my suggestion Spijkenisse Book Mountain - the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain has been lifted up.
It part a revitalisation project, which also includes an car park, a supermarket, a post office a small number adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, with a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012" competition.
In addition, the project is also for the Dutch Wood Award 2012.
Thus, faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town behind whose white facades one would to find a dairy plant, has been bolstered by a piece contemporary architecture.
First and foremost, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in history of its existence.
The long journey to book
first impression: the Eldorado books beneath a cheese dome.
There is in fact lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, however, the true joys of space literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot.
The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker and the elegant street speak the unmistakable language of a public town square.
The urban ambiance is perfect.
are on the lookout for a park a dog, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books.
"Normally book shelves run along the facade, and the centre there is a large, space, which is unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading inside
The interior of Bücherberg is cleverly used: in centre there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an centre the central technical room.
One particularly special are the black book shelves, simultaneously act as wall cladding, parapets and for the stairway.
The appearance, and scent are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials.
"Here we wanted to with recyclable materials," explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for the Municipality of on request the Standard.
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture, on a farm.
For many millimetre-thick fabric has been in and fields in the Netherlands as a layer.
It is inexpensive and saves time.
The thin textile lasts seasons and is then disposed of bulk waste.
For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouw plastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous and robust material, that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers.
After steps you have reached summit.
At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature not only with a fantastic view of the city, also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, the air humidity in the literary mountain range.
Donations for the new soul
"You hardly believe it, but this building, in spite of the many glass panels, a showcase project in the area of ecology," said Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled using geothermal
the Bücherberg has a cover, the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny
The broad, laminated wood glue beams positioned at right-angles to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight.
The indoor temperature very pleasant.
The rest is taken care by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan initially a sceptic of the sector, has already ventured the new library.
Verhaig also already.
So too has TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde, who even to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the inauguration just a few weeks ago, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his/her personal collection.
This was, for time being, fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items.
The has been a success.
The shelves are full to capacity.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," said architect
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain with this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
As such, MVRDV have succeeded mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity.

young and uneducated it may be.
This is ultimately a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine, from voting.
According to Stephen Szabo, Expert in US-European relations, in so Berlin walking a thin diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status within the United Nations.
However, Berlin subsequently abstained from voting.

Stephen Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cautious.
At the time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in in March 2011, Germany likewise abstained from voting, when it came to no-fly zone.
This was ultimately implemented NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to a clear position when it comes to important international affairs?
Yes, it does.
That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the USA, in favour of a German foreign policy.
This situation aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised
The Germans thus find themselves caught fronts.
It is expected of them they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to.
I believe they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to "more normal" policy.
A foreign similar to of or Great Britain.
So specifically does a "normal" policy entail, from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe the German foreign is motivated by the economic policy, that by and its with certain regions such as Russia, China or Near East.
Germany's economic interests to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these interests had an their attitude towards the Near East conflict their voting in UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Near and particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public, but the elite in the Arabic countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
However, I wouldn't want ascribe weight to this. This is not an entirely one-sided
Nonetheless, it play an role in Germany's considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA, by abstaining to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great the German position prevails.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
Perhaps it even earn Germany a certain degree of
all, it signals that the country be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on other hand, have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences opinion between the USA and the many European nations?
Due to the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
It is my belief that actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Obama is really not quite so enthused by policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on one hand, and the position of its most important partners the on the other?
I think that this precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans.
It would of be a little simpler for Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own
This is precisely what they are doing the Euro.
I believe in Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European
This is, of course, simple task for Germany, on account its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive
Yet I do that Germans clear they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds difficult to play a more prominent
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, anti-German become apparent.
This does make matters simple for the Germans.
This is actually the same old problem: does not want to be surrounded hostile countries.
From this stance, Germany in much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling vacuum, so who is filling the

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
However, what is Armani
Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China, however, one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the companies.
Nonetheless, it is enjoying protection, provided actual creators of the do not sue.
And even it is not clear whether they will have any rights.
"It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners protect their brands China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer within the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in infringement the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
All the copycats require a few additional letters in order that they register their brands.
Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny is in place of Prada.
German companies are also 'legally' copied in this manner, such manufacturer of sporting apparel, Puma.
Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office Peking.
On 14 September a Chinese copyrighted the brand name DF Puma an that also helps itself to the name fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property
In the major cities there are multi-level department stores sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases, however, are slightly different: on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese can granted the right to use a name by the trademark office, fully officially, which is already protected elsewhere.
Chinese call this "Bang a passenger brand.
word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women who latch onto rich
The Chinese are unaware of any wrongdoing.
"This harms business and we must fight it," challenges Pattloch.
"The brand watered down, its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of affected amount into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to information from research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest for luxury items, the
However, the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve, and cost a pretty penny.
The process can last for up to years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases, because after long period of time, name which the objection is raised has become a "market reality."
If the complainant is unlucky, he even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on in said
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails
Famous cases also to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction manufacturer Sany, the company recently acquired German pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Even today, the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use emblem that resembles the Mercedes

Fashion house Lacoste lost a suit China against copycats from Hong Kong Singapore, who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment.
In the past year, things "returned to following this emergency situation regarding work flow."
Thus the of unprocessed proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cased were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous
Nonetheless, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.

The applies for the inventory of valid trademarks, totalling 5.5 million in number.
In 2011, billion yuan in were received.
Put simply, this means that each costs on average yuan, or 160 euros.
To appeal an application costs many times this amount, can be seen in the case of the German family business, Freudenberg.
For more than years, group has been contesting against a plagiarist.
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company's illegal manufacturing motor vehicle parts.
However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This is something missed ourselves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in
The CTMO office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day.
You have pay careful attention.
The matter is now before Supreme Court.
Wentzler confident that the matter be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also says: "The process is extremely and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs can barely be calculated, the company archive even had to look through records in order to provide
Five ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high sum in as settlement.

For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a sector the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless to prevent the registration.
"You have to pay extremely careful attention," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very when conducting business China.
It is not sufficient on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register that is in any worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee.
In actual fact: if Freudenberg were to loose at the hurdle of its trademark drama, they would probably have to the opposing party license fees for use of their own name, explained Wentzler.
Or alternatively we would be forced out the market the respective sector.
World AIDS day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in the Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.

Only then do voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano surge, beguile and
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth, yet wild gestures.
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi Choir are practising a new song.
The fifteen singers, aging from 23 to 69 years old, range from human geneticists to the maintenance man.
"Om'Obani" is by means a simple piece, with each voice having different text, and an extremely foreign language that: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.

In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller worshipper.
In this region, no-one can speak Bantu language fluently, they can sing it.
For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign, language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.
For an 8,733-kilometre flight away from Heidelberg, in the west of the Swaziland Kingdom, lies the village of Esitjeni, relies on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and the majority of them are children.
More than of them no longer have parents, as to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni get a small foreshadow of the from which all of Swaziland is suffering: to Unicef, region has the HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy the world.

More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in you mid-thirties is by no means rare.
On a trip to Africa in early the Choir visited village, but first and foremost, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, lacking not in parental care but in practically everything else as well: food, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, there are barely opportunities, particularly in a poor country.
Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him/her to have one warm meal a day for few euros year.
However, just one year later, the choir the "Voices for Africa" which since then been looking after the AIDS in Esitjeni at an almost level.
Facts on transmitted infections.
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma viruses, herpes genitalis and hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies belong among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men that intercourse with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men.
heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses are frequently occurring transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in country is relatively low; however, around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more in other groups.
to European surveys, three quarters of all infections young people between the of 15 25.
In this country, human papilloma are also frequently found in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001, to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of newly cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2,700 cases.
This around one tenth fewer than the previous year.
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters warts.
However, often they no pain or any other symptoms, thus remaining undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, do offer 100% protection.
This is because occasionally, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases also passed via smear infections and close bodily contact.
Therefore, first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
If diagnosed early, the majority of STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany, money all adds up.
"In total, we have already sent 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," Annette Lennartz, Chairperson of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, self-assured and assertive manages the money from Germany.
She makes sure that orphans have good accommodation, for example one grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old ladies called in are the pillars the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them, providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually every day, in their school uniforms.
Anyone who doesn't have anyone left, arrives at the shelter with Khanyisile, a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two cooks who for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV.
This nothing to be taken for granted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country, the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead.

Among other factors, the fact that the HIV virus spread quickly the past number of decades can also be attributed officially sanctioned lifestyle.
factor is the large number of migrant who carry the virus across the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, said Annette Lennartz, "but are hardly used.
The culture prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-esteem, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from times of apartheid.

And if you make the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, to visit the stomping in their rehearsal room, you'll that the light is there too.

This is home of the Caucasian people group, the Talysh, of not much known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and long lives.
The final is Lerik.
The small town is bursting with architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't fit the picturesque mountain landscape all.
Tourists from Europe rarely come here; the journey from Azerbaijan's capital city, Baku, is too arduous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, too much of the route just a single track.

However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach a age with striking regularity.
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age.
So do many very old people live here in the south?
Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due the special Talysh genetics.
In contrast, Museum Director believes that it is due to diet.
However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.

The drink can kill the smell.

If you can avoid passing under your nose, it is not bad - not a slice sushi has been on rather a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of very different, poverty-stricken times Norway when, pre-refrigeration, fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Then in the depths winter, well and fermented, it is out and - no doubt the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten.

We not very showy, we do like ostentation.
Norway has handled its wealth very carefully - all but a percentage of money the industry is in a fund for the benefit of future generations.

Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he's alleging he suffered in
While cross-examining Manning at a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers nine months of detention at Quantico, no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing on defense motion to have Manning's dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.

Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses.
When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his "excellent" and treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."
forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment, Fein contended.
Manning responded he would verbally express concern about issues that the visiting officers would talk the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed, but they didn't record issues.
"They would write down issues' (after discussing the concerns), and it didn't necessarily mean I didn't bring something Manning
The judge, Col. Lind, also asked Manning he didn't complain about treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier.

The military said they put him on restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others.

Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada, create a European trading bloc North America.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he offered no specifics.
For Mexico, the relationship the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings.
Most Americans probably never give a to the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half territory at the point of rifle.
But for Mexicans, who in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico, hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are encroaching upon their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children Montezuma go on the warpath.
yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in United States.
You want to talk about hard
is plenty.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country provides and others whom it doesn't.
The reason you have so people of Mexican ancestry living in like Los Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San is because, at some in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, that person fit a -- dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc.

But though the Israelis Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, all them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has thrown the in the air, and, like or not, the Palestinians Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil.

However, there reasons for thinking it could just break their stalemate.

killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza's 1.7m in one of the most wretched crowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed Hamas is on the West Bank, the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists the Arab world clout, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken up Hamas's cause; so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states.
Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad, and down through Jordan, where Hamas's are menacing the king.
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries, has changed region's balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 his downfall in 2011, had little for Hamas.

Meanwhile, hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In terms, Hamas has been put back in its box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved worth and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as as ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.

That pragmatic Mr worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark start of something.
Israelis too look to the longer term.

Repression is already democracy in Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells.

Both sides need prodding by outsiders
answer remains the one trumpeted by sensible people on both sides, of the outside world and this newspaper: states, with Israel ceding territory for security.
The hope - a small one in the short term - is the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause.
Egypt, which must now set about stopping the flow of into Gaza, along with Turkey Qatar, is placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the boundaries with land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arab outsiders should also Hamas and Fatah to come together.

Mr Obama has part in getting Israel the table.

Cigarette plain packaging laws into force Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that the same all tobacco brands
Australia's world-first laws on cigarette and packaging have come into force, replacing brand logos and colours with generic drab olive green gruesome pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and made ill by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the health warnings and images the only difference between the mandatory from are the brand names, and these are all printed in small font.
It is the world's most for the packaging tobacco.
Australia's government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour.
It is relying on studies showing if people have not smoking by age 26 there is a 99% chance they will never take it up.
"Even from a very early age you can see understand the that the tobacco company is to sell through their branding," said federal health minister, Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, children linking a crown a logo with the idea of being a princess.
Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals' profits, other are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws.
Tobacco firms said they boost black market trade, leading cheaper, more accessible cigarettes.
"There will serious unintended consequences the legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Australia.

Others say the laws have boosted

Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock.

The hitch, experts say, the popularity of social media with the very the plan targeting.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has online.
Australia has web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot overseas sites.
"If you are a tobacco marketer and you've only got this small window left to promote your products, online is place for you to be in," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in Joe" reviews of brands on social media sites YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask, is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they've gone to the trouble of making a video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has gone as far paying for Ukraine, Honduras the Dominican to challenge the new rules - countries are claiming the World Trade that trade is being unfairly despite of the countries having significant trade with
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held with other countries considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make warnings mandatory in 2001.
They now extend more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South and India.

In a Constantly World, It's Not to Be Bored
I spent five unexpected hours an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had difficulties and we to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time think about the subject of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious, even with distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shopping).
But increasingly, some academics child development experts are coming out in praise of boredom.
It's all right for us - and our children - to be on occasion, they say.
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents, perhaps fostering creativity.
And because most us are almost consistently one screen or another we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
should we embrace boredom?
Yes.
And
But I'll get back that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a recent phenomenon, with the advent of more leisure time.
Not so, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom actually has a very long history," he said.
There's Latin graffiti about boredom on the walls of Pompeii dating from the first century.
Then there's the question of how we define
The trouble is that it has been defined, and discussed, in many different ways, John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."
What separates boredom from apathy, he is that the person is not engaged but wants to
With apathy, he said, is no to do something.
The experience of boredom, he said, is "disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense time is passing slowly."
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood that while they can be people who are bored tend to see the problem as environment or the world, while people who are see the problem themselves.
we think we're when we just have difficulty concentrating.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape a a article.
groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable, while the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
The ones who heard the TV reported more boredom the other two groups they had difficulty concentrating but not sure why, and attributed that difficulty boredom.
When you're trying to focus on difficult or engaging task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one the authors of the study.
On other hand, when you're doing something dull, "such as looking for bad widgets on distracting music can help you be
fact, he said, we now know that squirming and often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
"Research shows that kids who are allowed to learn more and retain more than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay, a droning speaker, a particularly tedious
some are more likely to bored than others.
To measure this, researchers a "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so interests, have time to do everything."
scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology the University of West Florida, when it comes needing more, and a variety of, external stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty jaded lot.
In Reed Larson, a professor of human and development at the University Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a beeper.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom percentages now, 21 years later, be higher or lower.
But he said he did know that "adolescence is a peak period for boredom," largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my question: Is good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows.
On the other hand, philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than decades.
is the brain's way to tell you you should something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the doesn't always know most appropriate thing do.
you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it make you happy in short term, not in the long term.
So if child bored and you give him an iPad, may not be bored anymore, but he hasn't learned how to entertain himself, self regulate, Professor Fenske said.
And "that self-regulation transfers from one situation to other," he said.
Your kid doesn't learn to himself, gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor be too of it.
goal should to comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We frame it as we need to be more, but boredom is an agonizing, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.

"In environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he said, hard ways to engage the noise down."
In Colorado, No Playbook for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state: the possession of a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were pulled over.
After police officer marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for and drug paraphernalia - petty that each carry a $100 fine - and given a court date.
"We treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, answer in hundreds of minor cases depends less the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved a similar measure.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead marijuana cases are still citing people for possession.
At the time, several towns from the suburbs the Western mountains are voting to block new, state-licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This thing is quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington State are scratching their heads.
And they looking for guidance how to set up a system of licenses production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - by a deadline of Dec. 2013.
They say that Colorado, better or worse, is of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally.
"Colorado has a market, so they will be a good guide," said Brian E. a spokesman the Washington Control
no or system, Mr. Smith conceded, can do more than suggest what work.
"There's no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
Washington's takes effect on Dec. 6, which leaves a year of limbo during which the licensing system will not yet exist, but legalized possession will.
And there are mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time, like how to balance the state's mandate of "adequate access" to licensed with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school, park, playground or child care center.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis than in urban areas, particularly Seattle metropolitan area," said Livingston, a for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older, and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes "effective immediately."
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Colorado's Weld County, district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to press users into treatment.
Right now, 119 people face charges possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like Mesa County, voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer citing adults for of small amounts.
The county's district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported that but also decided not to dismiss all the possession cases.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although percent of Colorado supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the of government the legal system was never going to be simple.
And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence local officials the state's big green experiment.
"It's a cultural barrier" with attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don't really accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a frontier of legalized sales, they are also anxiously awaiting direction the government, which still plans to treat the sale of marijuana as federal crimes.
for legalized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana and sellers, the federal government mostly allowed marijuana to operate in Colorado, Washington 16 other states.
While drug will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of drug, they are likely to balk at allowing the state-regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shops, even though it will about a year before any can open.

Yet, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history, I'd packed my bags, precipitating the first scandal of my life.

I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a adviser Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter.
Why bring this up now, you might ask.
Well, recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right-of-centre students are suffering a similar persecution.
Such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal-rights protection as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus College's junior common room (JCR) claim they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.

At other universities, Conservative students say are being treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction higher tuition fees."

"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous
Somerset House, former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place the British capital worthy of hosting a Garavani exhibition.
During the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture," designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace" says, in unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "signore" Garavani, although it could not have written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are a number of letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera, northern Italy, to idol of jet-set.
There is nothing with loving royalty.
"At least they don't cigarette on your magnificent carpet, like some pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.

Garavani's life not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love.
He loves well-educated people who come from good and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed a glamorous, sixty-foot catwalk which offers a role reversal: visitors take the place of models and have parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream wearing Valentino masterpieces, for example, the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding Aristotle Onassis, the Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" and the wool leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of mannequins, names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg.

Many these clients say your first Valentino is like your first "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.

Once the top, make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then, lugging their heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Ngrimbi Candi, a company which, since 1960, has been exploiting the volcano, and quite literally its workers, whom it pays 662 rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells the sulphur for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the as the is widely used in everyday life and is used in the of fireworks, cosmetics, and even for whitening sugar.

Defying the shadows, Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money.
Some 400 porters carry baskets on their shoulders from the crater.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has mechanised the sulphur extraction process to costs, nor it provided any equipment for the porters, who for themselves and by the kilo.
In fact, they not even see any of the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euro) per surcharge that, on top of the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euro) entrance fee, the guards of this charge to tourists who come photograph the volcano and their human mules.

Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and the cost of property and for not having
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely verses are part of advert for mint sweets, but in spite this - or perhaps because of - the video went viral on Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap and use local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that the advertisement will to focus attention to problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, he wanted the power of to make people their "national
It's purely an Internet thing, had to make it fun and amusing.
It's the biggest facing this
We are the world's worst reproducing our own progeny, so we felt it was issue we had to address.
We knew the Government had tried many things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily
So we thought: why not be as creative as possible to the problem, by composing a rap?
1.2
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly.
It spends USD 1,300 per year on policies encourage people to have more children.
A government package marriages and parents up to USD 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes benefits.
But this has all had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high technology city Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism its leaders its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, its national population division, stands at 1.2 children woman.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why are Singaporeans not having children?
Tan Wei Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said that it is a result of "better education" and wider range of career opportunities."
has given people a wider range of options in terms life goals and beyond getting married and starting a family" he explains.
These changes social norms have to increasing numbers of people who are single, and delaying marriage and births, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created among the local population.
Singapore, are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants and thinly disguised, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why, year, the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an to correct the problem, with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs immigration in Singapore's case there are also some unexpected consequences.
The Government trying not build so many small houses.
For example, has started to influence the real sector.
Its urban development authority has started to control the of small apartments, known "shoe which can in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses.
But, Lim Yew managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much than units.
They are more popular, in the that the units days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This means they are much for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers, who previously had put in their way if they provided for too many small units in project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State.
Although these new may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district, it seems they will not have much impact.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so education, a of people are putting off having a family" says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But, for me, it is important to my own money and time" says another young of around 20 years old.
and alike their careers, stress and the cost property and education as the reasons them from having children.
So, much as the Government trying to encourage its citizens have children, it comes to babies, the Singaporeans the last word.

Key questions
Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and they should understand that the of media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed" he says.
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky, with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, coined these terms explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives children and young born with technology.
"We are the immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still in learning" he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or divulge, at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this."
also to be when what matters most is to popular and thousands of friends, without thinking of the he adds.
According to specialist, the most effective way teach children and teenagers what privacy is, through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not do it is no good" he adds.
Porras then lists options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it online?
Or, would like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
you what others publish about you?
When tagging photos, did you ask the other people's permission to tag them?
one more question: does need to know what you're doing the time?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do
The rules are the same.
"Outside the act respect, morality and other principles, so they should act the same way on social networks" he says.

"South America learn from Europe to integrate citizenship" says
The President of Ecuador, Rafael said today that the creation common citizenship is a goal that "South in this case, learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the Eleventh Summit the of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Peru's state television that Europeans "killed another in the Second World War" conflicts, "but are now practically country."
To this end, he defended project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries UNASUR.
"We have to achieve the movement citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community. However, there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past" he said.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the of the Organisation of American States (OAS) the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account who have signed the Pact San José on human rights.
Those who speak with authority never commit to whereas we South everything.
"It is incomprehensible that Inter-American Commission Human Rights is in Washington under US funding" he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added at the time, "he reasonable suspicion that Assange would extradited to another country that his case would not be respected."
he the courts demanding that he be subject to for an alleged sexual in his country, when "Swedish legislation itself dictates that he be questioned via videoconference, which could be done from Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
said that there is a risk deterioration of Assange's and mental health.
"I have not to him since he was at our embassy, the ambassador informed me that he had a lung problem, nothing the President.
What there is, is the his physical and mental health may due to being locked a small space without any outdoor exercise.
"That would complicate health of person" he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy, in London, through the of a safe-conduct pass that permits travel Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
to problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is handling a series of cases in different European courts" he said.
And he felt that "if Britain says no to the pass, it's over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly well it to do, and as it has done other questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press stated that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of the freedom are evil and wicked politicians, but journalists depending on profit, blackmail and extortion" he said.
In that regard, he welcomed fact that it was no longer these journalists, "or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador" and said that, if re-elected, he will "step up the revolution to continue the same path and in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UNASUR, at least until next elections, arguing that the "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality" because this will in fact "destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly pertinent" of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries, after ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, in favour Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For now that ruling is not followed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward.
Additionally, he trusted in sound conclusion to the boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing, however hard it may be."
With reference to possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive he said he sees that possibility "with much and joy, although at times it is pretty hard."
Correa said that if he loses the elections February 2013, will retire from public life.
Personally, I've been interested in but situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be corrected by
"My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory, so we have to accept responsibility" he said.
If I won, it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life.
If I lose, likewise.
"It's a decision" he confirmed.
Correa to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment Cuba.

Deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when confirmed his test HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me" he says, recalling the time of the the doctor was trying to make apparently unsuccessfully.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to for his illness alone and began learn about it; thanks to his efforts he just celebrated 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one oldest in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (CHG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 22 years, hard to imagine in early '90s, when there were many questions, few treatment and a great deal of stigma.
Then, even the director of IMSS [Mexican Social Security clinic refused to discharge him "because he had a cut."
At that time, having Aids was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive syndrome do so with of life.
However, many people are still unaware their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
years after of onset of AIDS around the world, least since the first reported "the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general is exactly equal" stated the head CHG Unit, Andrade Villanueva, saying that information was endorsed in this year in scientific journal.
Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that 2008 had concluded that was not a death sentence, but life expectancy and quality of depend the degree of the immune system that patients present they are with a life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 for those reporting a 500 count.
In simple terms, this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old, under these terms and long as they keep it under control, can live with no problems to 75" said the interviewee.
To gauge this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years in the of Mexico, the number people dying of AIDS has from in 2007 to in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since advent AIDS, 60 per cent of patients the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, only 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, we are assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are do still deaths occur?
I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment.
That's how I view it, and that's how been at our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years had no shortage of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive in advanced state of illness because they unaware of their HIV status, that is to say, the later stages of the disease.
He gave a compelling statistic: "Nine out of patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, so needs be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, offer mass detection tests for everyone needs them. "
Specialists and officials of the State Council AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) on this as do the patients themselves, such as who came to be tested at a private laboratory, motivated only because a friend had done and, despite his young age, he was around the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour is one of the complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a blow-out three times a they but not in case.
The change was for the better; I eat well, I exercise, I take my drugs.
To his parents are only aware he had cancer.
I live as normal a as anyone else.
"I I take part in a lot of activities, I I have an active but sex I take care of myself and the other person" said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MILENIO JALISCO, those people his story in the context of World Day, are afraid.
They should get tested are at risk. because the sooner they if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they have already been they must learn to live any other person, while responsible.
This his message, which summarises the of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter.
The gaps between health programmes ordinary citizens are huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up HIV cause.
And the greatest cure
places dedicated this task distribution condoms has actually previously, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packets of a and that's fine, but it turns out there are still out there who have no access condoms" he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers, counsellors, pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do want to expose to sex, said the speaker.
It was decided to change such inefficient allocation, that condoms should not only be placed behind counters, but that packets of one hundred be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people.
This is not promoting promiscuity.
It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees, as Gonzalez said, when asked there would be distribution of condoms during his administration.
"And it's not sexuality, but it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity" he said.
key points
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state 4th in nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and in HIV.
92% of new infections are through sex, 6% via the bloodstream 2% perinatal.
estimated 50,000 people may living with HIV, for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who not know are positive.
Ratified by United States court of appeal, a judgement which ignores restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring that solvency problems.
It seems, that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the judgement delivered on by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenceless possible of their property outside of Mexico.
However, the decision opens door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
From the the judge that creditors should be governed by the States Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, states that the main action the insolvency action handled in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles.
Indeed, the UN Model Law Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute positioned arbitrator.
judgement that without the intercompany vote, with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised the critical of the insolvency, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might be achieved.
However, Mexican law recognises the possibility.
In fact, the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted.
There are a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
What is also certain that, not including the of subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, did achieve a majority.
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37.
This data is omitted by the Court Appeal.
From another perspective, the latter blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by United turning its back on the country.
now, the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the that is, the judges, given that only three voted previously.
Should this fail, an appeal for review by a higher court, in this case the US Supreme Court, will be filed.
The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amicus ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, noting that the latter discharged itself adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
it should be that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, ensuring fairness for debtors creditors.
Double whammy: Vitro hit and hit.
Balance Sheet
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of mismanagement, dormant for several months, the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck.

Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, travelled the world.
Few in Puerto have a mental recollection local basketball history as as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
was immersed in the sport for over years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a he minor league player, National Superior Basketball player, representative and manager with Bayamón Vaqueros or President of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like I president the BSN, general manager federative president of the National Team during the '90s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where lives with Isabel, his for over 50
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career, which goes to prove
Bayamón at heart
Of them all, the ones he treasures the emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with Vaqueros, from the mid-50s as a player 1982, when he completed 15 years serving as co-agent or agent of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I the opportunity to of the Vaqueros' eight championships, since 1967, either as agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many good years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year the BSN.
Then "Cuco" Ortiz took over - was a manager" said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama to me 'I've got a very strong for tall.
Do you want him?'
And that was the beginning of one of the best players Rico ever had.
then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond, who established here and was of our best
I remember him that Mincy had given Bayamon one Gausse would help get another.
The Vaqueros' with Gausse was enjoyed, but from a distance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot.
For time, he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincy's accomplishments in national team.
I remember when we the United States for the time during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for second said
the 1990 World National Team the best you've ever seen?
It's one of the best, as good as the one that beat the Dream in the Olympics.
However, my was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we gold and gave the US team a beating, was quite to the time we won at the World
That team not only included Mincy, Gausse, Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) Mario 'Quijote' who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury.
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, which gave a gold medal and was a joy to work with, was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players such as 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after shambles of the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games, we won gold against all the
Who was the best Puerto Rican player?
Without any Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto manager?
That's a difficult one.
We had a very good team, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the youngsters, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part the National most glorious between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in season.
What was there left for you to do?
There were things I'd have liked to implement, such as regionalising minor leagues.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and get to face teams from other of the island in the playoffs.
now the kids are riding and playing too much, unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you now?
most I do listen to watch music from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the my wife, who has always been with me.

But was his interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom.
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The tagline "Who shot JR?," to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments.

Start of a course that explores "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This term, when Professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to give course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling hook: The end of the "long countdown" of Mayan calendar, 21 December, which had many people that the end of the coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice some "debt Armageddon" a growing conflict involving Israel, where end-of-the-world Christians theorists think the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realise this was going to be the most term ever" said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you look at what been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And is not the only professor who offers on the "end of the world" this term, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and global warming.
"We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time" he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour.
If material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analysed movies an apocalyptic theme and how they compare with real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform what is possible, probable, credible and said Vacker.
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus, American History Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Art History and Anthropology have teamed up to give a course, called simply "The end of the world."
"We don't add '2012' so we always have the option running the course again, if the world doesn't come to an said Restall.
Despite "impending students have to study, undertake projects and take exams.
At Penn State, the final will taken on the of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night world is supposed end" Restall.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was fully booked within two hours" said on his course for students with high averages, which was filled 35 students.

Students, meanwhile, say course is one of the most interesting around.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves" said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield, New at Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I'd never heard of a class that could teach he said.
I enjoy it.
But none the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in end date of December 21st.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and a certain extent we discredited it" said Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple, from West Chester.
Mayans never predicted the end of the world: it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall.
he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these
other places, people don't think about it" he said.
It's mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of at La Salle University, who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world" wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority.
We have an indulgence from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking of the next date" or philosophising December 21st the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
they plan to go to "end of the world"
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can a laugh together" said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
