A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer the United States than the number of people killed lightning.
Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter
this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of elections in the United States.
It this spirit that a majority have passed new since 2009 making the registration or process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained following the 2010 elections, which 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws voters to show a photo card and proof of US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record.
Before 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to such requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, sponsored bills in States to voters to photo ID card.
It is important to note that, Quebec, American citizens do not a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters 2012 do have identification.
And it often costs a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, of African 15% of those earning less than 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.
And that's not all.
voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States allow fishing or hunting members, who vote more Republican, to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote.
Prior to no proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona the to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the party.
What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they the right of individuals and groups to assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of in the State.
The same applied to Hispanics.
These only 11% of voters, of citizens who voted early.
the other hand, of voters were white but these represented only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the
For example, 16 out of 34 have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise right to vote in 2012.
critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see clear objective of influencing 2012 results in key States.
A 2011 Brennan report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.
It too early to say with certainty legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact the turn-out.
In this sense, the measures undermine the American democratic system.
screening: take the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes results with false negative or false positive results, which involve unnecessary medical interventions.
Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests.
Take the test not?
We two specialists for their opinion.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who screened and those were not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it is between 30 and 40% more likely for metastases to in the absence of screening.
I therefore recommend the test from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily prostate that are not long-term life and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring the
Today, many men in cancer been detected will be treated because their cancer not aggressive and is not life threatening.
Active monitoring will be suggested, if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated.
Therefore I recommend taking

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated if everyone ate well and exercised enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If more people this rate would increase to at least says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that roughly 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Some are also completely
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.

This massively damages people's health.

Likewise, so do cured meat products, and these should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cells in the body and lead to the of cancer" it is explained.

For the time being however their research is inconclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the
