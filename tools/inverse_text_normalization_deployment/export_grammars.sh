# This script compiles and exports WFST-grammars from nemo_tools inverse text normalization, builds C++ production backend Sparrowhawk (https://github.com/google/sparrowhawk) in docker, 
# pluggs grammars into Sparrowhawk and returns prompt inside docker.
# To run inverse text normalization, run e.g.
#       echo "two dollars fifty" | ../../src/bin/normalizer_main --config=sparrowhawk_configuration.ascii_proto
