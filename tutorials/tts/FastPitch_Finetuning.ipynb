    "### Finetuning HiFiGAN\n",
    "From the synthesized samples, there might be audible audio crackling. To fix this, we need to finetune HiFiGAN on the new speaker's data. HiFiGAN shows improvement using synthesized mel spectrograms, so the first step is to generate mel spectrograms with our finetuned FastPitch model.\n",
